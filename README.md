# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Project
Credit card fraud detection, which is a data mining problem, becomes challenging due to two major reasons – first, the profiles of normal and fraudulent behaviours change constantly and secondly, credit card fraud data sets are highly skewed. The performance of fraud detection in credit card transactions is greatly affected by the sampling approach on dataset, selection of variables and detection technique(s) used.

This project investigates the performance of naïve bayes, k-nearest neighbor, svm and logistic regression on highly skewed credit card fraud data.
Dataset of credit card transactions is sourced from European cardholders containing 284,807 transactions. Under-sampling technique is carried out on the skewed data.

The performance of the techniques is evaluated based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, Matthews correlation coefficient and balanced classification rate. The results shows of optimal accuracy for naïve bayes, k-nearest neighbor, svm and logistic regression classifiers are 92.4%, 97.69%, 93.6 and 92.6%
